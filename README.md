# Control Flow
## If statements, else, elif
If statements evaluate a condition and perform an action if True. They follow the syntax:

```
if <condition>:
    <action>
```


## For loops
For loops iterate through data and complete an action provided the condition is satisfied. The syntax is as follows:
```
for variable in <data_collection>:
    <action>
```


## While Loops
* While loops are executed when a certain condition is True.
* They will continue to execute until the condition has been met.
* They are typically used for monitoring purposes.
* The ```break``` and ```continue``` keywords are important in while loops as they help control the flow of the loop. 
* The syntax is as follows:
```
while <condition> is True:
    <action>
```
### Why do we have while loops if we have for loops?
For loops only loop for amount of data in a loop
whereas while loops continue looping until a certain condition is met.
