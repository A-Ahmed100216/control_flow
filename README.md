# Control Flow
## If statements, else, elif
If statements evaluate a condition and perform an action if True. They follow the syntax:

```
if <condition>:
    <action>
```


## For loops
For loops iterate through data and complete an action provided the condition is satisfied. The syntax is as follows:
```
for variable in <data_collection>:
    <action>
```

## While Loops
While loops are executed when a certain condition is True. The syntax is as follows:
```
while <condition> is True:
    <action>
```
